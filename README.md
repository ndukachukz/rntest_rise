## 1. Clearing Cache <a name="clearing-cache"></a>

Clearing the cache can resolve various issues that might arise during the development and testing of your React Native application. Follow these steps to clear the cache:

1. **Clear Metro Bundler Cache**:

   To clear the Metro Bundler cache, run the following command in your project's root directory:

   ```bash
   npx react-native start --reset-cache
   ```

2. **Clear Android Build Cache**:

   If you're encountering issues related to the Android build, you can clear the Android build cache by running the following command:

   ```bash
   cd android && ./gradlew clean
   ```

3. **Clear iOS Build Cache**:

   For iOS, you can clear the build cache by deleting the `DerivedData` folder. The path is generally:

   ```
   ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/
   ```

   Delete the contents of the `DerivedData` folder.

## 2. Building APK <a name="building-apk"></a>

Building the APK (Android Package) is an important step in preparing your React Native app for distribution or testing on Android devices. Here's how you can build the APK:

run `yarn build:apk` or follow the steps below.

1. **Navigate to the Android Directory**:

   Open your terminal and navigate to the `android` directory of your React Native project:

   ```bash
   cd android
   ```

2. **Build the APK**:

   To build the APK, use the following Gradle command:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleRelease
   ```

   This command will trigger the build process and create the APK file.

3. **Generated APK Location**:

   Once the build process is complete, you can find the generated APK file at the following location:

   ```
   rise/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
   ```

   Replace `rise` with your actual project's directory name.

## 3. Locating Built APK Files <a name="locating-built-apk-files"></a>

After building the APK, you can easily locate the generated APK files using the file paths provided in the previous section:

- For release APK: `rise/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

Remember to replace `rise` with the actual name of your project's directory.
